Slack
=====

"Slack is the end result of all quests of a carnal or spiritual nature." -- Philo's Historie (The SubGenius Psychlopaedia of Slack)

Slack is a 2D game library written in scala, intended to provide functional reactive programming tools for game 
programming and wrap Slick2D.

I began by exploring scala.React, although I've now given up on that project for now -- and am now exploring [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
as a model.

Important: There are two scripts for downloading the necessary native libraries for Linux and OSX.

At the moment, there is an initial ReactiveGame which implements Slick's BasicGame and a runnable test
that is primarily for initial experiments with scala.React and Slick. Slick's Scrollable demo has been ported to Scala,
but not with a functional approach.
