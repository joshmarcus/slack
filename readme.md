Slack
=====

"Slack is the end result of all quests of a carnal or spiritual nature." -- Philo's Historie (The SubGenius Psychlopaedia of Slack)

Slack is a 2D game library written in scala, intended to be a scala port of Slick2D that provides 
functional reactive programming tools for game programming.  

The project has included the source from scala.React, which isn't "production quality" but is interesting.

At the moment, there are just some initial experiments.
